## Windows Server Installation ü™ü

When it's done downloading, open your VMware Workstation and go to

**File > New Virtual machine**

As shown below:

<center> <img src="/5.png" width="400" height="400" /> </center>

Continue with typical and click next:

<center> <img src="/6.png" width="400" height="600" /> </center>

Browse and select your Windows server file
(the one named SERVER_EVAL_x64FRE_en-us) and click next:

<center> <img src="/7.png" width="500" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

Just leave the windows key screen empty:

<center> <img src="/8.png" width="500" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

Keep it 60 GB and select the "Split Virtual Disk into multiple files" option and click next:

<center> <img src="/9.png" width="500" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

Untick the "Power on this virtual machine after creation" option and click Finish.

Now go to vmware settings by right clicking on the vm name and click settings as shown below:

<center> <img src="/11.png" width="400" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

Here you want to do two things:

- If your pc has 16 GB RAM select 4 GB RAM here:
- Select the floppy disk (if its there in the devices) and click remove on the bottom (it is troublesome when you are installing the Windows OS Later)
Once that is done, launch your VM.

Keep clicking next until you come to this screen, then make sure you select Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience):

<center> <img src="/13.png" width="600" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

In the next screen, make sure to select custom:

<center> <img src="/14.png" width="600" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

Click ‚òÄÔ∏èNew:

<center> <img src="/15.png" width="700" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

Click Apply then your disk will be partitioned, click next:

<center> <img src="/16.png" width="500" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

Once you're done with the installation, it'll ask you for your password. Use a weak password that you can remember and that actually follows the password rules: (or just use P@$$w0rd!)

<Callout title="Suggestion"> I **highly** recommend writing these passwords somewhere.</Callout>

<center> <img src="/18.png" width="700" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

When you first log on to the machine, the screen will be small as shown below:

<center> <img src="/19.png" width="800" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

To solve this issue, download vmware tools by clicking on Workstation > VM > Install VMware Tools :

<center> <img src="/20.png" width="500" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

If the option is greyed out, don't worry, I got you

Follow this guide and it should work: https://www.ghacks.net/2019/04/25/how-to-install-vmware-tools-if-the-option-is-grayed-out/

Once you've installed vmware tools, go to file explorer in the vm and a dvd drive should be visible, click on that and run setup64. Once its done, restart your machine:

<center> <img src="/21.png" width="800" height="600" class="center" /> </center>

We're done with installing the Windows Server. In the next section we'll be installing and setting up the Domain Controller. See you there!
